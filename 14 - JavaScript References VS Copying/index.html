    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Mark';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'John';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = "Tux";
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = "Pux";
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Sux";
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Vux";
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 55 });
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread - WE HAVE THIS NOW... works in Chrome
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.age = 38;
    console.log(person, cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(wes, dev);

    // Above is fine, dev is changed, wes is not... however...

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes.social, dev.social);

    // DAMN!!! It changed both. You would need to deep clone to clone all levels of Object.
    // One workaround could be...
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@coolman2';
    console.log(dev.social, dev2.social);

    // Above may have performance issues, so maybe use with caution.
